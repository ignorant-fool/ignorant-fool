Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm Harrison / @ignorant-fool.

I'm an exploration geodata scientist currently working at Rio Tinto Exploration, based in Perth, Australia. 
I completed a Bachelor of Mathematics / Science from the University of Queensland, with majors in Statistics and Geological Sciences, followed up by an Honours degree in Exploration Geophysics.

I'm interested in applying advanced statistics and data science techniques to geoscientific data, particularly in the exploration and ore-body knowledge space. 
I've got plenty of experience working with R and Python, and _probably_ remember enough Fortran from my undergrad to read through some geophysical processing code _if I really have too_.
I've also worked a little with C and SQL, however definitely not an expert in either.

I am comfortable with using Windows, MacOS, and Linux (I use Arch and Asahi btw). 
My editor of choice is _VS Code_, my terminal of choice is _Alacritty_, and my shell of choice is _fish_. 

Outside of work and study, you can find me play and listening to terrible music, drinking an unhealthy amount of coffee and tea, and reading way too much manga.
