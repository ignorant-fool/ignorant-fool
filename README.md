Hi friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm Harrison / @ignorant-fool.

I'm an exploration geodata scientist currently working at Rio Tinto Exploration, based in Perth, Australia.

I've just started my Master of Data Science at UWA, after completing my undergrad at UQ where I completed a Bachelor of Mathematics and Bachelor of Science with majors in statistics and geological sciences, followed up by an Honours degree in exploration geophysics! 

I'm interested in applying advanced statistics and data science techniques to geoscientific data, particularly in the exploration and ore-body knowledge space. 
I've got plenty of experience working with R and Python, and _probably_ remember enough Fortran from my undergrad to read through some geophysical processing code _if I really have too_.
At university this semester I'm learning C++ for HPC, SQL in relational databases, and Bayesian modelling in R using both JAGS and Stan.

I am comfortable with using Windows, MacOS, and Linux (I use Arch and Asahi btw). 
My editor of choice is _VS Code_, my terminal of choice is _Alacritty_, and my shell of choice is _fish_. 

Outside of work and study, you can find me climbing (and falling) the ranked ladder in TeamFight Tactics, drinking an unhealthy amount of coffee and tea, and reading way too much manga.
